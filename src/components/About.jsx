        I love music, so I compose and produce songs in my free time or enjoy
        playing guitar or keys. I take pleasure in a good book with a coffee
        cup. I like to read about topics that help me to grow, so psychology,
        personal finances, or interpersonal and intrapersonal skills books are
        my go-to choices.
